# Using Variables

To expand a variable in shell script, prefix the variable name with a
dollar sign. For example:

```
foo=hello
echo $foo
```

The variable `$foo` is substituted with its value, if any, after the
expansion. In the above example, `$foo` expands to the string `hello`,
so the output looks like this:

```
hello
```
