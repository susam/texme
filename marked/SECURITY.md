# Security Policy

The only completely secure system is the one that doesn't exist in the first place.
Having said that, we take the security of Marked very seriously.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please disclose potential security issues by email to the project [committers](https://marked.js.org/#/AUTHORS.md) as well as the [listed owners within NPM](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/owner).
We will provide an initial assessment of security reports within 48 hours and should apply patches within 2 weeks
(also, feel free to contribute a fix for the issue).
